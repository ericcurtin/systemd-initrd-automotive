# usystemd-dracut

## Overview

usystemd-dracut is a reference implementation for the smallest systemd-based initramfs that can be built using dracut (pretty much). It is designed to demonstrate the essential functionality required for an initramfs, including performing a switchroot to a root filesystem and supporting the loading of kernel modules.

## Features

- Minimalistic systemd-based initramfs.
- Built using dracut.
- Includes functionality for loading kernel modules dynamically.
- Performs a switchroot.
